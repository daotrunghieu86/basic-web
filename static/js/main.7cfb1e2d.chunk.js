Jack: And I'm Jack. Welcome to Everyday English. Sarah: Today we're going to be talking about a pretty important topic \u2013 spending money! Jack: If you're going to be spending money here in Australia, you're going to be using these: dollars. The Aussie dollar or Australian dollar is the official Australian currency. Although here, we just call them dollars. Sarah: The smaller unit of currency is cents. One dollar is made up of 100 cents. Jack: One way to spend money is using cash which in Australia comes in notes and coins. Let's have a look at the different denominations that Australia's currency comes in. Let's start with the coins. We've got 2 dollars, 1 dollar, 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. Sarah: And then there are the notes. We've got 5 dollars, 10 dollars, 20 dollars, 50 dollars and 100 dollars. Although I don't see too many of these, do you Jack? Jack: No, I'm afraid not! Sarah: Now you can get cash out or withdraw cash from the bank or from an ATM which stands for automatic teller machine. Jack: But of course, it\u2019s pretty common for people to pay without cash using a credit card, a debit card or even your phone. Sarah: We sometimes call that a cashless transaction or just paying by card. Let's have a look at a scenario involving spending money. Sara: Hi Charlotte, how are you? Charlotte: Good thanks, Sara. Sara: What can I get for you today? Charlotte: How much are your sandwiches? Sara: Sandwiches are 5.50. Charlotte: What about the pies? Sara: 4 dollars 60. Charlotte: Alright I\u2019ll grab a pie and a can of lemonade. Sara: Yeah no problem. That's just 9 dollars 80. Sara: Do you have anything smaller? I don\u2019t have much change. Charlotte: Sorry Sara. I don\u2019t have any loose change. I just went to the ATM and all I have are 50s. Do you take card? Sara: Yeah no problem. Credit or savings? Charlotte: Credit. Sara: All good. Charlotte: Thanks so much. Have a good day! Sara: You too! Jack: You might have noticed there that when people talked about prices, they often dropped the words dollars and cents. For example, instead of saying five dollars fifty cents, we could say five fifty. Or five dollars fifty. Sarah: You have to listen carefully to the pronunciation of numbers because sometimes, they can sound quite similar. For example: 50 and 15. It can be hard to hear the difference between the -ty and the -teen. There's also thirteen and thirty, fourteen and forty, sixteen and sixty, seventeen and seventy, eighteen and eighty and, nineteen and ninety. Jack: So we've talked about buying smaller things with cash and cards but how about spending money on bigger things like cars and houses? Sarah: For bigger purchases like homes or cars, you may have to take out a loan from the bank. Loan is a noun and it means something that is given out temporarily, in this case money, with the expectation that it will be given back later. The verb is lend. And the past tense of lend is lent. If you take out a loan, you become a borrower. You borrow the bank's money. And you have to repay it or make repayments. A loan that's for a house is called a home loan or a mortgage. Jack: If you take out a loan, you will have to pay interest. That means the amount of money you owe will increase by a certain percentage. Sarah: Percentage is a unit of measurement that means a part of 100. So, for example 50 per cent means half. Jack: On a home loan you might have to pay 5% interest which means the amount you owe will increase by 5% every year. Banks will also charge interest on credit cards which let you spend money that you don't actually have as long as you pay it back later! Sarah: Let's have a look at some more words that are associated with spending. There's buy. The past tense is bought."))}}]),a}(n.Component),f=function(e){function a(){return Object(l.a)(this,a),Object(c.a)(this,Object(u.a)(a).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(d.a)(a,e),Object(h.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"wel-contact"},o.a.createElement("h3",null,"I want to learn everything about computers."),"Hello. I'm a guy in Tennessee. My name is Tyler. I want to learn everything about computers. Well I have a big problem. I don't have even the most remote elementary knowledge about technology or computers in general. My question isn't simple and I've googled plenty of times, but it is hard to find answers to questions if you can't find the questions being answered. I was wondering: What is the first step in learning about computers? Specifically what TYPES of things does one learn? I know there's PC hardware handling people learn, and then there's something my friend called \"networking\", and then there's coding and programming and scripting and I don't even know what those are or if there's even a difference between them. Basically what I'm saying is this: I am a blank canvas, and I don't know what color to start painting in. Whenever I do google searches or try to find information about first steps I am FLOODED with terms and ideas that I don't understand at all. And then flipping through wikipedia pages looking at computer and programming related pages further baffles my already elementary mind. Where do I start? Should I jump into \"coding\"? Should I fetch some crappy computer pieces and start building computers? What about networking? How do I go about even finding information about it? Everything I find seems to be for people who already know about networking and what they're doing. What other things do people even do with computers other than build them, program programs, set up networks so they can talk to each other?")}}]),a}(n.Component),w=t(25);function b(){var e=Object(i.a)(["\n  display: flex;\n"]);return b=function(){return e},e}var v=function(e){function a(){return Object(l.a)(this,a),Object(c.a)(this,Object(u.a)(a).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(d.a)(a,e),Object(h.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement(m.a,null,o.a.createElement("nav",{className:"navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark d-flex justify-content-between px-5"},o.a.createElement(m.b,{className:"navbar-brand",to:"/"},"Logo"),o.a.createElement("ul",{className:"navbar-nav"},o.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},o.a.createElement(m.b,{to:"/",className:"nav-link",href:"#"},"Home")),o.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},o.a.createElement(m.b,{to:"/about",className:"nav-link",href:"#"},"About")),o.a.createElement("li",{className:"nav-item"},o.a.createElement(m.b,{to:"/contact",className:"nav-link",href:"#"},"Contact")))),o.a.createElement(y.c,null,o.a.createElement(y.a,{path:"/",exact:!0},o.a.createElement(k,null),o.a.createElement(p,null)),o.a.createElement(y.a,{path:"/about"},o.a.createElement(k,null),o.a.createElement(g,null)),o.a.createElement(y.a,{path:"/contact"},o.a.createElement(k,null),o.a.createElement(f,null)),o.a.createElement(y.a,{render:function(){return o.a.createElement("h1",null,"Page not found")}}))))}}]),a}(n.Component);function k(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"welcome"},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"wel-content"},o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Welcome"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Learn to code from the word")))}w.a.ul(b());var E=function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement(v,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));t(43);s.a.render(o.a.createElement(E,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))}},[[30,1,2]]]);
